* 2.0.4
  handle mac universal builds for arches besides x86 and ppc (e.g. x86_64)
  use rpath?
  cms example: User.pem expired.  probably other certs need regen also?
  fix publickeyexample.  it encrypts with cms, decrypts with raw rsa??
  qcatool: instead of printing full usage at every wrong turn, we might try
    to print something closer to the context
  publickey: use_asker_fallback should use ErrorPassphrase
  cmssigner: convert path separators in field when loading a pkcs11 module
  cert: better makeFriendlyName diffing for key usage (consider OIDs) ?
  cert unit tests need to test wildcards!!
  consider a more readable implementation of qca_securelayer logic using the
    object-sessions concept (write the blog first :))
  vs2005: big_io.obj : warning LNK4221: no public symbols found; archive
    member will be inaccessible 

* 2.1.0
  CertificateAuthority constructor provider argument should have default value
  CertificateAuthority::createCertificate declared but not implemented!
  CertificateCollection: ability to remove certs/crls?
  pull kwallet's SecureBuffer?

* possibilities for the future:
  abort if feature requested but not found, rather than crashing
  examples: bigint, pgp, tls with smartcards (reuse ssltest?), more?
  unittests: pgp enc/dec, cms, sasl, tls, filewatch/dirwatch
  complete pkits unittests
  don't expose windows.h in qpipe.h, find another way to get HANDLE
  cert: ability to get a list of all validation errors, rather than just one
  the securelayer system doesn't respond to the app if processed data yields
    no events (an example of this would be a partially-received encrypted
    payload).  since securelayer is async, an app could end up waiting for
    a response that is never going to come.  the current workaround is to wait
    some event cycles and then give up (see the saslclient example).  the fix
    is probably to make the securelayer system always respond to the app once
    data has been processed, whether or not the processing yields anything
    interesting yet.
  find a better way for a provider to automatically promote itself?  (see
    qca-wingss)
  can we ever get SASL::NoAuthzid?
  make it possible to change GNUPGHOME and have qca-gnupg respect the change?
    see pgpunittest.
  why is Logger a QObject?
  it seems strange that Logger friends QCA::Global...
  operator==,!= for PGPKey?
  gss/kerberos interface?
  spnego?
  make sure it is possible to add new public key types (e.g. ECC).  right now
    it looks like qca_publickey is hard-coded sometimes (such as canVerify()
    returning true only for RSA and DSA public keys, no way to override this
    in a plugin...)
  if you store a typical self-signed cert into the system store as a way to
    trust it, does that make you vulnerable to the cert signing other certs?
  make distinction between invalid ca and ca not found
  make distinction between depth 0 self-signed and self-signed in chain
  use Q_PROPERTY on some things (e.g. TLS::compressionEnabled) ?
  signRequest should allow specifying the serial number
  qca-ossl: give credit to tim and "openssl" itself, not just eric?
  tls: should there be an explicit property for requesting a certificate in
    server mode?  right now qca-ossl simply always asks for a cert
  publickey: ability to compare keys without IO support
  provider: separate public and private keys into two classes to enable
    delegation easier.  the public part should not be implemented by most
    providers.
  provider: make it possible to support RSA and DSA keys without implementing
    a separate class for each.
  qcatool: streaming securemessage operations
  access to list of known cached certs, similar to how cmssigner works?
  securemessage: ability to know which key has performed a decrypt?
  emsa3Encode: implement in provider instead of qca?
  OCSP
  securelayer: ability to specify how much to read, rather than just read all
  tls ocsp stapling
  tls: pgp, psk auth ?
  internally managed intermediate object storage
  securemessage: algorithm selection for cms/pgp (and use SecurityLevel?)
  tls: renegotiation
  Key wrapping - RFC3217 and RFC3394
  quoted-printable TextFilter
  keygen on smart cards
  keystore: symmetric keys, arbitrary app data
  cert: any other fields we don't support but might be used out there
  cert: support for arbitrary extensions?
  cms: fine-grained control over smime attribs
  convertToPublic should return a publickey rather than change itself
  providers for:
    Mozilla NSS
    Windows CryptoAPI
    Linux kernel crypto support, if the userspace API ever gets sorted out
    Intel Performance Primatives library
    Botan: partly implemented
    EGD / EGADS: implement for Random support
