/**
   \class Hash qca_basic.h QtCrypto

   General class for hashing algorithms.

   Hash is the class for the various hashing algorithms
   within %QCA. SHA256, SHA1 or RIPEMD160 are recommended for
   new applications, although MD2, MD4, MD5 or SHA0 may be
   applicable (for interoperability reasons) for some
   applications.

   To perform a hash, you create a Hash object, call update()
   with the data that needs to be hashed, and then call
   final(), which returns a QByteArray of the hash result. An
   example (using the SHA1 hash, with 1000 updates of a 1000
   byte string) is shown below:

   \code
if(!QCA::isSupported("sha1"))
	printf("SHA1 not supported!\n");
else
{
	QByteArray fillerString;
	fillerString.fill('a', 1000);

	QCA::Hash shaHash("sha1");
	for (int i=0; i<1000; i++)
		shaHash.update(fillerString);
	QByteArray hashResult = shaHash.final();
	if ( "34aa973cd4c4daa4f61eeb2bdbad27316534016f" == QCA::arrayToHex(hashResult) )
	{
		printf("big SHA1 is OK\n");
	}
	else
	{
		printf("big SHA1 failed\n");
	}
}
   \endcode

   If you only have a simple hash requirement - a single
   string that is fully available in memory at one time - then
   you may be better off with one of the convenience
   methods. So, for example, instead of creating a QCA::Hash
   object, then doing a single update() and the final() call;
   you could simply call QCA::Hash("algoName").hash() with the
   data that you would otherwise have provided to the update()
   call.

   \page hashing Hashing Algorithms

   There are a range of hashing algorithms available in
   %QCA. Hashing algorithms are used with the Hash and
   MessageAuthenticationCode classes.

   The MD2 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as the
   message and outputs a condensed 128 bit (16 byte)
   representation of that data stream, known as the message
   digest. This algorithm is considered slightly more secure than MD5,
   but is more expensive to compute. Unless backward
   compatibility or interoperability are considerations, you
   are better off using the SHA1 or RIPEMD160 hashing algorithms.
   For more information on %MD2, see B. Kalinski RFC1319 "The %MD2
   Message-Digest Algorithm". The label for MD2 is "md2".

   The MD4 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as the
   message and outputs a condensed 128 bit (16 byte)
   representation of that data stream, known as the message
   digest. MD4 is not considered to be secure, based on
   known attacks. It should only be used for applications where
   collision attacks are not a consideration (for example, as
   used in the rsync algorithm for fingerprinting blocks of
   data). If a secure hash is required, you are better off using
   the SHA1 or RIPEMD160 hashing algorithms. MD2 and MD5 are both
   stronger 128 bit hashes.  For more information on MD4, see
   R. Rivest RFC1320 "The %MD4 Message-Digest Algorithm". The
   label for MD4 is "md4".

   The MD5 takes an arbitrary data stream, known as the message
   and outputs a condensed 128 bit (16 byte) representation of
   that data stream, known as the message digest. MD5 is not
   considered to be secure, based on known attacks. It should
   only be used for applications where collision attacks are not
   a consideration. If a secure hash is required, you are better
   off using the SHA1 or RIPEMD160 hashing algorithms.  For more
   information on MD5, see R. Rivest RFC1321 "The %MD5
   Message-Digest Algorithm". The label for MD5 is "md5".

   The RIPEMD160 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known
   as the message (up to \f$2^{64}\f$ bits in length) and outputs
   a condensed 160 bit (20 byte) representation of that data
   stream, known as the message digest. The RIPEMD160 algorithm
   is considered secure in that it is considered computationally
   infeasible to find the message that produced the message
   digest. The label for RIPEMD160 is "ripemd160".

   The SHA-0 algorithm is a 160 bit hashing function, no longer
   recommended for new applications because of known (partial)
   attacks against it. The label for SHA-0 is "sha0".

   The SHA-1 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as
   the message (up to \f$2^{64}\f$ bits in length) and outputs a
   condensed 160 bit (20 byte) representation of that data
   stream, known as the message digest. SHA-1 is considered
   secure in that it is considered computationally infeasible to
   find the message that produced the message digest. For more
   information on the SHA-1 algorithm,, see Federal Information
   Processing Standard Publication 180-2 "Specifications for the
   Secure %Hash Standard", available from

   The SHA-224 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as
   the message (up to \f$2^{64}\f$ bits in length) and outputs a
   condensed 224 bit (28 byte) representation of that data
   stream, known as the message digest. SHA-224 is a "cut down"
   version of SHA-256, and you may be better off using SHA-256 in
   new designs. The SHA-224 algorithm is considered secure in
   that it is considered computationally infeasible to find the

   Standard", with change notice 1, available from
   http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/. The label for SHA-224 is
   "sha224".

   The SHA-256 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as
   the message (up to \f$2^{64}\f$ bits in length) and outputs a
   condensed 256 bit (32 byte) representation of that data
   stream, known as the message digest. The SHA-256 algorithm is

   The SHA-384 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as
   the message (up to \f$2^{128}\f$ bits in length) and outputs a
   condensed 384 bit (48 byte) representation of that data
   stream, known as the message digest. The SHA-384 algorithm is
   a "cut down" version of SHA-512, and you may be better off

   The SHA-512 algorithm takes an arbitrary data stream, known as
   the message (up to \f$2^{128}\f$ bits in length) and outputs a
   condensed 512 bit (64 byte) representation of that data
   stream, known as the message digest. The SHA-512 algorithm is

/**
   \page paddingDescription Padding

   For those Cipher sub-classes that are block based, there are modes
   that require a full block on encryption and decryption - %Cipher Block
   Chaining mode and Electronic Code Book modes are good examples.

   Since real world messages are not always a convenient multiple of a
   block size, we have to adding <i>padding</i>. There are a number of
   padding modes that %QCA supports, including not doing any padding
   at all.

   If you are not going to use padding, then you can pass 
   QCA::Cipher::NoPadding as the pad argument to the Cipher sub-class,
   however it is then your responsibility to pass in appropriate data for
   the mode that you are using.

   The most common padding scheme is known as PKCS#7 (also PKCS#1), and
   it specifies that the pad bytes are all equal to the length of the 
   padding ( for example, if you need three pad bytes to complete the block,
   then the padding is 0x03 0x03 0x03 ). PKCS#5 padding is a subset of
   PKCS#7 padding for 8 byte block sizes. For explanation, see
   http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9043/what-is-the-difference-between-pkcs5-padding-and-pkcs7-padding/9044#9044.

   On encryption, for algorithm / mode combinations that require
   padding, you will get a block of ciphertext when the input plain
   text block is complete. When you call final(), you will get out the
   ciphertext that corresponds to the last part of the plain text,
   plus any padding. If you had provided plaintext that matched up
   with a block size, then the cipher text block is generated from
   pure padding - you always get at least some padding, to ensure that
   the padding can be safely removed on decryption.

   On decryption, for algorithm / mode combinations that use padding,
   you will get back a block of plaintext when the input ciphertext block
   is complete. When you call final(), you will get a block that has been
   stripped of ciphertext.
*/

/**
   \class Cipher qca_basic.h QtCrypto

   General class for cipher (encryption / decryption) algorithms.

   Cipher is the class for the various algorithms that perform
   low level encryption and decryption within %QCA.

   AES128, AES192 and AES256 are recommended for new applications.

   Standard names for ciphers are:
   - Blowfish - "blowfish"
   - TripleDES - "tripledes"
   - DES - "des"
   - AES128 - "aes128"
   - AES192 - "aes192"
   - AES256 - "aes256"
   - CAST5 (CAST-128) - "cast5"

   When checking for the availability of a particular kind
   of cipher operation (e.g. AES128 in CBC mode with PKCS7
   padding), you append the mode and padding type (in that
   example "aes128-cbc-pkcs7"). CFB and OFB modes don't use
   padding, so they are always just the cipher name followed
   by the mode (e.g. "blowfish-cfb" or "aes192-ofb"). If
   you are not using padding with CBC mode (i.e. you are
   ensuring block size operations yourself), just use 
   the cipher name followed by "-cbc" (e.g. "blowfish-cbc"
   or "aes256-cbc").
