Qt Cryptographic Architecture (QCA)
-----------------------------------

About QCA
---------
This library provides an easy API for a range of cryptographic
features, including SSL/TLS, X.509 certificates, SASL, symmetric
ciphers, public key ciphers, hashes and much more.

Functionality is supplied via plugins.  This is useful for avoiding
dependence on a particular crypto library and makes upgrading easier,
as there is no need to recompile your application when adding or
upgrading a crypto plugin.  Also, by pushing crypto functionality into
plugins, your application is free of legal issues, such as export
regulation.


Building from a Source package
------------------------------

See the 'INSTALL' file.


Building from CVS/SVN
---------------------

First, compile and install the 'qconf' program.  You'll need the CVS
version of it, and here are the instructions:

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.anywise.org:/psi
cvs login
cvs co qconf

Then compile qconf using the usual "./configure, make, make install"
procedure.

Finally, go into the QCA source tree and type 'qconf'.  You should now
have a configure script to execute.

When you execute that script, you should see something like the following:

     Configuring Qt Cryptographic Architecture (QCA) ...
     Verifying Qt 4 build environment ... ok
     Checking for certstore ... using bundled

     Good, your configure finished.  Now run /usr/bin/gmake.

If so, you can just run (g)make to build QCA. If not, have a look at
conf.log to see what might have gone wrong.


You will also need to build appropriate plugins to get support for
many of the QCA features.
